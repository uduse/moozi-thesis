% \subsection*{Artificial Intelligence}

% % Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that emphasizes the use of computer algorithms to solve problems likes humans.
% To define the goals and methods of Artificial Intelligence (AI), we first need to define what is \textit{intelligence}.
% Though there is no consensus on the exact definition of intelligence, here we adopt the definition by John McCarthy:
% \begin{quote}
%     Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.
% \end{quote}
% The goal of AI is to develop computer algorithms that can solve problems and achieve goals in complex environments.
% A diverse range of methods are designed as AI algorithms since the term has been coined.
% \note{A simple list of AI algorithms, such as A*, symbolic}
