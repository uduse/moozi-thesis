% \subsubsection{Initial Inference and Recurrent Inference}
% For the initial inference,
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item input features $\psi_t = (o_{t - L + 1}, \dots, o_t, a_{t - L}, \dots, a_{t -1})$
%     \item obtain $\mathbf{x}_t^0 = h(\psi_t)$
%     \item obtain $v^0_t, \mathbf{p}^0_t = f(\mathbf{x}_t^0)$
%     \item set $\hat{r}_t^0 = 0$
%     \item return $(\mathbf{x}^0_t, v_t^0, \hat{r}_t^0, \mathbf{p}^0_t)$
% \end{itemize}
% For the recurrent inference,
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item input features $\mathbf{x}_t^i, a_t^i$
%     \item obtain $\mathbf{x}_t^{i+1}, \hat{r}_t^{i+1} = g(\mathbf{x}_t^i, a_t^i)$
%     \item obtain $v^{i+1}_t, \mathbf{p}^{i+1}_t = f(\mathbf{x}_t^{i+1})$
%     \item return $(\mathbf{x}^{i+1}_t, v_t^{i+1}, \hat{r}_t^{i+1}, \mathbf{p}^{i+1}_t)$
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Rollout Workers} \label{sec:rw}
% \textbf{Rollout workers} are ray actors that store copies of environments or history trajectories and generated data by evaluating policies and interacting with the environments or history trajectories (also see \ref{sec:ray}).
% A rollout worker does not inherently serve a specific purpose in the system and its behavior is mostly determined by the configuration of it.
% There are three main types of rollout workers used in MooZi: \textbf{Training Worker}, \textbf{interaction testing rollout worker}, and \textbf{reanalyze rollout worker}.

\subsection{Our Approach}
\note{(5 pages)}

% The most significant difference of our approach is the separation of data and process.
% In the Agent-Environment Interface, both the agent and the environment are assumed to be stateful, which means they could store and process arbitrary data.

% \subsubsection{Generalized Interaction Interface}
% We propose the \textbf{Generalized Interaction Interface (GII)}.
% We define the \textbf{tape} $E$ as the data storage of the interface, and a \textbf{law} $L$ as a pure function that operates on the tape.
% An instance of such interface could consists of exactly one tape and multiple laws, and we define such an instance a \textbf{universe}.
% A universe \textbf{ticks} by applying the laws on the tape.
% \note{elaborate formally}

% We implement a simplified version of this interface in \textbf{MooZi}.

% % \note{elaborate on the interface}

% \subsubsection{Advantages}
% \note{pure functions are efficient}

% See \ref{code:training_worker} for the pseudo-code of this process.
% The planner of these workers are configured to have more exploration to generate more diverse data.
% The exploration is encouraged by setting a greater \Verb|dirichlet_fraction|, a greater \Verb|dirichlet_alpha|, and a greater \Verb|temperature|. \note{move these parameters into planner section}
