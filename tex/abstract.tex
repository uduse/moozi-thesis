% The abstract is a concise and accurate summary of the thesis. It states the
% problem that was researched, the methods of investigation, and the general
% conclusions. An abstract must not contain non-text content, such as tables,
% graphs, complex equations, or illustrations. Even for theses containing
% journal articles, there is one single abstract for the entire work, included
% within the preliminary pages (front pages) of the thesis. For any thesis that
% is permitted to be written in a language other than English, two abstracts
% must be included; the first in English and the second in the language of the
% thesis. The font used for the abstract must be at least a 10 point font, with
% the text double-spaced, to ensure readability. A strict maximum word count of
% 700 words applies, regardless of whether the abstract is for a master's or a
% doctoral degree (many abstracts are 300-500 words).

    \noindent The intent of this thesis is to develop a high-performance open-source system that plans with a learned model and to understand the algorithm through extensive analysis.
    We formulate the problem of maximizing accumulated rewards in Markov Decision Processes, and we frame playing games as such problems.
    We develop the \moozi system to solve these problems.
    \moozi includes
    (1) a MuZero-based algorithm that plans with a learned model 
    (2) a distributed architecture that trains and evaluates the algorithm efficiently, and
    (3) a collection of tools to visualize and understand the algorithm.
    We empirically show that \moozi outperforms PPO and AC in MinAtar environments.
    We also show that \moozi learns to play the two-players board game \textit{Breakthrough}.
    We use our tools to analyze the learned model by visualizing search trees and learned representation.
    We make \moozi publicly available to accelerate future research.
